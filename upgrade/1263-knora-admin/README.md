# Separate the knora-admin ontology from knora-base

With [PR #1263](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/pull/1263), the `knora-admin`
ontology has been separated from the `knora-base` ontology. The program
`update-knora-admin.py` in this directory changes your existing data and ontologies
accordingly.

## Instructions

Use `./update-knora-admin.py` in this directory to update your repository. You will
need to specify some command-line options; type `./update-knora-admin.py --help` for
details.
