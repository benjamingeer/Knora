/**
  * Creates the ApiMayChange annotation.
  *
  * Marks APIs that are meant to evolve towards becoming stable APIs, but are not stable APIs yet.
  *
  * <p>Evolving interfaces MAY change from one patch release to another (i.e. 2.4.10 to 2.4.11)
  * without up-front notice. A best-effort approach is taken to not cause more breakage than really
  * necessary, and usual deprecation techniques are utilised while evolving these APIs, however there
  * is NO strong guarantee regarding the source or binary compatibility of APIs marked using this
  * annotation.
  *
  * <p>It MAY also change when promoting the API to stable, for example such changes may include
  * removal of deprecated methods that were introduced during the evolution and final refactoring
  * that were deferred because they would have introduced to much breaking changes during the
  * evolution phase.
  *
  * <p>Promoting the API to stable MAY happen in a patch release.
  *
  * <p>It is encouraged to document in ScalaDoc how exactly this API is expected to evolve.
