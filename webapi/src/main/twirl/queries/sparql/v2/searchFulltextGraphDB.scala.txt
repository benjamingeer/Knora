 * Performs a simple full-text search using GraphDB.
 *
 * This template is used only by searchFulltext.scala.txt.
 *
 * Since the triplestore type is GraphDB, we assume that inference is enabled, and we use it to optimise the generated
 * SPARQL. Specifically, we use inference to return search results matching subclasses of the resource class
 * specified by the user. This requires us to use GraphDB's GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> whenever
 * we need to get explicit (non-inferred) statements.
 *
 * @param searchTerms search terms.
 * @param preferredLanguage the language code of the user's preferred language.
