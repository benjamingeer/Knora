# Lucene Query Parser Syntax

Full-text searches in Knora are based on Lucene. 
Therefore, full-text searches support the 
[Lucene Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html).

A full-text search consists of a single word in the simplest case, but could also be composed of several words combined with 
[Boolean operators](https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Boolean_operators).
By default, Lucene combines two or more terms separated by space with a logical OR.

For examples, see
