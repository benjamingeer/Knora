## Creating a Value

To create a value in an existing resource, use this route:

```
HTTP POST to http://host/v2/values
```

The body of the request is a JSON-LD document in the
@ref:[complex API schema](introduction.md#api-schema), specifying the resource's IRI and type,
the resource property, and the content of the value. The representation of the value
is the same as when it is returned in a `GET` request, except that its IRI and `knora-api:attachedToUser`
are not given. For example, to create an integer value:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 4
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

Each value can have a comment, given in `knora-api:valueHasComment`. For example:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 4,
    "knora-api:valueHasComment" : "This is a comment."
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

Permissions for the new value can be given by adding `knora-api:hasPermissions`. For example:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 4,
    "knora-api:hasPermissions" : "CR knora-base:Creator|V http://rdfh.ch/groups/0001/thing-searcher"
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

The format of the object of `knora-api:hasPermissions` is described in
@ref:[Permissions](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#permissions).

If permissions are not given, configurable default permissions are used
(see @ref:[Default Object Access Permissions](../../05-internals/design/api-admin/administration.md#default-object-access-permissions)).

To create a value, the user must have **modify permission** on the containing resource.

The response is a JSON-LD document containing only `@id` and `@type`, returning the IRI
and type of the value that was created.

### Creating a Link Between Resources

To create a link, you must create a `knora-api:LinkValue`, which represents metadata about the
link. The property that connects the resource to the `LinkValue` is a link value property, whose
name is constructed by adding `Value` to the name of the link property
(see @ref:[Links Between Resources](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#links-between-resources)).
The triple representing the direct link between the resources is created automatically. For
example, if the link property that should connect the resources is `anything:hasOtherThing`,
we can create a link like this:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasOtherThingValue" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:LinkValue",
    "knora-api:linkValueHasTargetIri" : {
      "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/tPfZeNMvRVujCQqbIbvO0A"
    }
  },
  "@context" : {
    "xsd" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

As with ordinary values, permissions on links can be specified by adding `knora-api:hasPermissions`.

### Creating a Text Value Without Standoff Markup

Use the predicate `knora-api:valueAsString` of `knora-api:TextValue`:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasText" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:TextValue",
    "knora-api:valueAsString" : "This is a text without markup."
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

### Creating a Text Value with Standoff Markup

Currently, the only way to create a text value with standoff markup is to submit it in XML format
using an @ref:[XML-to-standoff mapping](xml-to-standoff-mapping.md). For example, suppose we use
the standard mapping, `http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping`. We can then make an XML
document like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<text>
   This text links to another <a class="salsah-link" href="http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing">resource</a>.
</text>
```

This document can then be embedded in a JSON-LD request, using the predicate `knora-api:textValueAsXml`:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasText" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:TextValue",
    "knora-api:textValueAsXml" : "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<text>\n   This text links to another <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing\">resource</a>.\n</text>",
    "knora-api:textValueHasMapping" : {
      "@id": "http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping"
    }
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

Note that quotation marks and line breaks in the XML must be escaped, and that the IRI of the mapping must be
provided.

## Creating File Values

Knora supports the storage of certain types of data as files, using
[Sipi](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Sipi)
(see @ref:[FileValue](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#FileValue)).
Knora API v2 currently supports using Sipi to store image files. Support for
other types of files will be added in the near future.

The following sections describe the steps for creating a file value.

### Upload Files to Sipi

The first step is to upload one or more files to Sipi, using a
`multipart/form-data` request, where `sipihost` represents the host and
port on which Sipi is running:

```
HTTP POST to http://sipihost/upload?token=TOKEN
```

The `token` parameter must provide the [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/)
that Knora returned when the client logged in. Each body part in the request
must contain a parameter `filename`, providing the file's original filename,
which both Knora and Sipi will store; these filenames can be descriptive
and need not be unique.

Sipi will then convert the uploaded image files to JPEG 2000 format and store
them in a temporary location. If this is successful, it will return a JSON
response that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "uploadedFiles": [{
    "originalFilename": "manuscript-1234-page-1.tiff",
    "internalFilename": "3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2",
    "temporaryBaseIIIFUrl": "http://sipihost/tmp/3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2"
  }, {
    "originalFilename": "manuscript-1234-page-2.tiff",
    "internalFilename": "2RvJgguglpe-B45EOk0Gx8H.jp2",
    "temporaryBaseIIIFUrl": "http://sipihost/tmp/2RvJgguglpe-B45EOk0Gx8H.jp2"
  }]
}
```

In this example, we uploaded two files to Sipi, so `uploadedFiles` is an
array with two elements. For each file, we have:

- the `originalFilename`, which we submitted when uploading the file
- the unique `internalFilename` that Sipi has randomly generated for the file
- the `temporaryBaseIIIFUrl`, which we can use to construct a IIIF URL for
  previewing the file

The client may now wish to get a thumbnail of each uploaded image, to allow
the user to confirm that the correct files have been uploaded. This can be done
by adding IIIF parameters to `temporaryBaseIIIFUrl`. For example, to get
a JPG thumbnail image that is 150 pixels wide, you would add
`/full/150,/0/default.jpg`.

### Submit A File Value to Knora

After uploading a file to Sipi, you can submit a request to Knora to create
a file value. The request submitted to Knora takes the same form as any other
request to create a value. Instead of providing the file's complete metadata,
you just provide the unique internal filename generated by Sipi. For example:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing-picture",
  "@type" : "anything:ThingPicture",
  "knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:StillImageFileValue",
    "knora-api:fileValueHasFilename" : "3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2"
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

Knora then gets the rest of the file's metadata from Sipi. If the client's
request to Knora is valid, Knora saves the file value in the triplestore and
instructs Sipi to move the file to permanent storage. Otherwise, the
temporary file that was stored by Sipi is deleted.

## Updating a Value

To update a value, use this route:

```
HTTP PUT to http://host/v2/values
```

Updating a value means creating a new version of an existing value. The new version
will have a different IRI. The request is the same as for creating a value, except that
the `@id` of the current value version is given. For example, to update an integer value:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg",
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 5
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

The value can be given a comment by using `knora-api:valueHasComment`. To change only
the comment of a value, you can resubmit the existing value with the updated comment.

Permissions can be specified by adding `knora-api:hasPermissions`. Otherwise, the new
version has the same permissions as the previous one. To change the permissions
on a value, the user must have **change rights permission** on the value.

To update a link, the user must have **modify permission** on the containing resource as
well as on the value.

The response is a JSON-LD document containing only `@id` and `@type`, returning the IRI
and type of the new value version.

If you submit an outdated value ID in a request to update a value, the response will be
an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error.

## Deleting a Value

Knora does not normally delete values; instead, it marks them as deleted, which means
that they do not appear in normal query results.

To mark a value as deleted, use this route:

```
HTTP DELETE to http://host/v2/values/RESOURCE_IRI/PROPERTY_IRI/VALUE_IRI[?deleteComment=DELETE_COMMENT]
```

The resource IRI, property IRI, and value IRI must be URL-encoded. If the value
is a link value, the property must be a link value property.

The optional URL parameter `deleteComment` specifies a comment to be attached to the
value, explaining why it has been marked as deleted. The comment must also be URL-encoded.
