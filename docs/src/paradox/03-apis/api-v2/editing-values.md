## Creating a Value

To create a value in an existing resource, use this route:

```
HTTP POST to http://host/v2/values
```

The body of the request is a JSON-LD document in the
@ref:[complex API schema](introduction.md#api-schema), specifying the resource's IRI and type,
the resource property, and the content of the value. The representation of the value
is the same as when it is returned in a `GET` request, except that its IRI is not
given. For example, to create an integer value:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 4
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

The response is a JSON-LD document containing only `@id` and `@type`, returning the IRI
and type of the value that was created.

### Creating a Link Between Resources

To create a link, you must create a `knora-api:LinkValue`, which represents metadata about the
link. The property that connects the resource to the `LinkValue` is a link value property, whose
name is constructed by adding `Value` to the name of the link property
(see @ref:[Links Between Resources](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#links-between-resources)).
The triple representing the direct link between the resources is created automatically. For
example, if the link property that should connect the resources is `anything:hasOtherThing`,
we can create a link like this:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasOtherThingValue" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:LinkValue",
    "knora-api:linkValueHasTargetIri" : {
      "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/tPfZeNMvRVujCQqbIbvO0A"
    }
  },
  "@context" : {
    "xsd" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

### Creating a Text Value with Standoff Markup

Currently, the only way to create a text value with standoff markup is to submit it in XML format
using an @ref:[XML-to-standoff mapping](xml-to-standoff-mapping.md). For example, suppose we use
the standard mapping, `http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping`. We can then make an XML
document like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<text>
   This text links to another <a class="salsah-link" href="http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing">resource</a>.
</text>
```

This document can then be embedded in a JSON-LD request to create a value:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasText" : {
    "@type" : "knora-api:TextValue",
    "knora-api:textValueAsXml" : "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<text>\n   This text links to another <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing\">resource</a>.\n</text>",
    "knora-api:textValueHasMapping" : {
      "@id": "http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping"
    }
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

Note that quotation marks and line breaks in the XML must be escaped, and that the IRI of the mapping must be
provided.

## Updating a Value

To update a value, use this route:

```
HTTP PUT to http://host/v2/values
```

Updating a value means creating a new version of an existing value. The new version
will have a different IRI. The request is the same as for creating a value, except that
the `@id` of the current value version is given. For example, to update an integer value:

```jsonld
{
  "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing",
  "@type" : "anything:Thing",
  "anything:hasInteger" : {
    "@id" : "http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg",
    "@type" : "knora-api:IntValue",
    "knora-api:intValueAsInt" : 5
  },
  "@context" : {
    "knora-api" : "http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#",
    "anything" : "http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#"
  }
}
```

The response is a JSON-LD document containing only `@id` and `@type`, returning the IRI
and type of the new value version.

If you submit an outdated value ID in a request to update a value, the response will be
an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error.

### Updating a Link Between Resources

When you update a `knora-api:LinkValue`, the existing direct link between the two resources
is deleted, the existing `LinkValue` is marked as deleted (and therefore becomes invisible
to normal queries), and a new direct link and a new `LinkValue` are created.
