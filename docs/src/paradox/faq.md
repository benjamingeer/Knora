# Frequently Asked Questions

@@toc { depth=2 }

## Triplestores

### Which triplestores can be used with Knora?

Knora is tested with [Ontotext GraphDB SE](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/).
Our goal is to support several triplestores, including open-source options.
Integration with [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/)
has been partly implemented, but is not currently supported.

## Knora Ontologies

### Can a project use classes or properties defined in another project's ontology?

No, and Knora API v2 will forbid this. Each project must be free to change its
own ontologies, but this is not possible if they have been used in ontologies or
data created by other projects.

Instead, there will be a process for standardising ontologies that can be shared
by multiple projects (issue @github[#523](#523)).

### Why doesn't Knora use `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` for consistency checking?

Knora's consistency checking uses Knora-specific properties, which are called
`knora-base:subjectClassConstraint` and `knora-base:objectClassConstraint` in
the `knora-base` ontology, and `knora-api:subjectType` and `knora-api:objectType`
in the `knora-api` ontologies. These properties express *restrictions* on the
possible subjects and objects of a property. If a property's subject or object
does not conform to the specified restrictions, Knora considers it an error.

In contrast,
[the RDF Schema specification says](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domainrange)
that `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` can be used to "infer additional information"
about the subjects and objects of properties, rather than to enforce restrictions.
This is, in fact, what RDFS reasoners do in practice. For example, consider these
statements:

```
example:hasAuthor rdfs:range example:Person .
data:book1 example:hasAuthor data:oxygen .
```

To an RDFS reasoner, the first statement means: if something is used as
the object of `example:hasAuthor`, we can infer that it's an
`example:Person`.

The second statement is a mistake; oxygen is not a person. But
an RDFS reasoner would infer that `data:oxygen` is actually an
`example:Person`, since it is used as the object of
`example:hasAuthor`. Queries looking for persons would then get
`data:oxygen` in their results, which would be incorrect.

Therefore, `rdfs:domain` and `rdfs:range` are not suitable for consistency
checking.

Knora therefore uses its own properties, along with
OWL cardinalities, which it interprets according to a "closed world"
assumption. Knora performs its own consistency checks to enforce
these restrictions. Knora repositories can also take advantage of
triplestore-specific consistency checking mechanisms.

The constraint language [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) may someday
provide a standard, triplestore-independent way to implement consistency
checks, if the obstacles to its adoption can be overcome
(see [Diverging views of SHACL](https://research.nuance.com/diverging-views-of-shacl/)).
For further discussion of these issues, see
[SHACL and OWL Compared](http://spinrdf.org/shacl-and-owl.html).
