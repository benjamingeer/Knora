# v1.8.0 Release Notes (not released yet)


See the
[release](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/releases/tag/v1.8.0) and closed tickets on the
[v1.8.0 milestone](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/milestone/12) on Github.


## Required changes to existing data:

## New features:

- add developer-centric docker-compose.yml for starting the Knora / GraphDB / Sipi / Salsah1 (@github[#979](#979))
- configure `webapi` and `salsah1` thorough environment variables (@github[#979](#979))
- update for Java 10 (@github[#979](#979))
- comment out the generation of fat jars from `KnoraBuild.sbt` (for now) (@github[#979](#979))
- update ehcache (@github[#979](#979))
- update sbt to 1.2.1 (@github[#979](#979))
- remove Kamon monitoring (for now) since we don't see anything meaningful there. We probably will have to instrument Knora by hand and then use Kamon for access. (@github[#979](#979))
- update Dockerfiles for `webapi` and `salsah1` (@github[#979](#979))
- Follow subClassOf when including ontologies in XML import schemas (@github[#991](#991))
- add support for adding list child nodes (@github[#991](#990))
- Add support for shared ontologies (@github[#987](#987))

## Bugfixes:

- trouble with xml-checker and/or consistency-checker during bulk import (@github[#978](#978))
- Ontology API error with link values (@github[#988](#988))
