# Publishing

Knora is published as a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images under the
[DHLab Basel Dockerhub Organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/dhlabbasel).

The following Docker images are published:

- Knora-API:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/dhlabbasel/webapi
- GraphDB-SE (includes `KnoraRules.pie`):
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/dhlabbasel/knora-graphdb-se
- GraphDB-Free (includes `KnoraRules.pie`):
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/dhlabbasel/knora-graphdb-free
- Sipi (includes Knora's Sipi scripts):
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/dhlabbasel/knora-sipi
- Knora-Assets (Knora-Base ontologies, test data, and scripts):
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/dhlabbasel/knora-assets

Knora's Docker images are published automatically through Travis each time a pull-request
is merged into the `develop` branch.

Each image is tagged with a version number, where the version is derived by using the result
of `git describe`. The describe version is built from the
`last tag + number of commits since tag + short hash`, e.g., `8.0.0-7-ga7827e9`.

### Using SBT for publishing

The images can be published locally by running:

```bash
$ - sbt webapi/docker:publishLocal
