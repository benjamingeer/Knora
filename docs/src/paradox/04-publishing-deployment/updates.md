# Updating Repositories When Upgrading Knora

@@toc

When a new version of Knora introduces changes that are not backwards-compatible
with existing data, you will need to update your repository. First, back up
your repository. Then follow the instructions below for the Knora version that
you are upgrading from.

## Upgrading from Knora 7.0.0 or Later

### Automatic Upgrade

The automatic upgrade procedure dumps your repository to a file, determines which transformations
are needed, transforms the file, then loads the transformed file back into the repository.
To perform an automatic upgrade, open a shell in the directory `upgrade/graphdb-se` and run the script
`./auto-upgrade.sh`. You must be in that directory when you run the script. For information on its
command line options, run it without arguments, or see the `README.md` in that directory for details.

### Manual Upgrade

If you need more control over the process (e.g. you want to use
GraphDB's [LoadRDF](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/free/loading-data-using-the-loadrdf-tool.html)
tool to upload the transformed file), follow the steps below.

#### 1. Dump the Repository to a TriG File

You can use the `dump-repository.sh` script in `upgrade/graphdb-se`. See
the `README.md` there for instructions.

#### 2. Transform the TriG File

In the `knora-api` directory of the version of Knora you are upgrading to, run:

```
sbt "upgrade/run INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE"
```

For `INPUT_FILE`, use the absolute path of the TriG file you downloaded in
step 1.

For `OUTPUT_FILE`, use the absolute path of the transformed TriG file to
be created.

The program automatically determines which transformations are needed.
If the repository is already up to date, the program will say so, and no
output file will be written. In this case, there is nothing more to do.
Otherwise, proceed to step 3.

#### 3. Empty the Repository

The transformed TriG file must be loaded into an empty repository.
To empty the repository, you can use the `empty-repository.sh` script in
`upgrade/graphdb-se`. See the `README.md` there for instructions.
Make sure you have backed up the repository first.

#### 4. Load the Transformed TriG File into the Repository

You can use the `upload-repository.sh` script in `upgrade/graphdb-se`. See
the `README.md` there for instructions.

If the file is very large, it may be more efficient to load it offline,
using GraphDB's [LoadRDF](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/free/loading-data-using-the-loadrdf-tool.html)
tool.
