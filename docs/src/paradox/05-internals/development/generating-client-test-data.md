# Generating Client Test Data

@@toc

## Requirements

Generate test requests and responses for Knora's routes, to be used in testing
client code without the need for a running Knora instance.
  
## Implementation

A class for each Knora API extends the `ClientApi` trait.
A `ClientApi` contains one or more `KnoraRoute` implementations that extend
`ClientEndpoint`. Each endpoint provides functions that return generated
client test data.

The route `ClientApiRoute` returns a Zip file containing generated test data.
returning source code in a Zip file.

## Usage

The following route returns a Zip file containing generated client test
data:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/clientapitest
```
