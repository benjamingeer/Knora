## Building Documentation

The complete Knora documentation site is built by invoking the following command:

```
$ sbt docs/makeSite
```

The generated documentation can be found under `docs/target/site/`. To preview your
generated site, you can run the following command:

```
$ sbt docs/previewSite
```

which launches a static web server, or:

```
$ sbt docs/previewAuto
```

which launches a dynamic server updating its content at each modification in your source files. Both launch the server
on port `4000` and attempt to connect your browser to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## 3 Publishing

To publish the documentation, you need to be on the `develop` branch inside the `docs` folder and then execute the following
command:

```
$ sbt docs/ghpagesPushSite
```

This command will build all documentation and publish it to the `gh-pages` branch.
