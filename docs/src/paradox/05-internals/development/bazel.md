# Bazel (Experimental)

The following section discusses on how to build and run tests for Knora-API
with [Bazel](https://bazel.build).

## Prerequisites

See the instruction for installing Bazel: https://docs.dasch.swiss/developers/

## Commands

Build `webapi`:

```
# build webapi
$ bazel build //webapi

# run api (webapi)
$ bazel run //:api

# run all tests
$ bazel test //...
```

## Build Structure

The Bazel build is defined in a number of files:
  - WORKSPACE - here are external dependencies defined
  - BUILD - there are a number of BUILD files throughout the directory structure
    where each represents a separate package responsible for everything underneath.
  - *.bzl - custom extensions loaded and used in BUILD files

For a more detailed discussion, please see the [Concepts and Terminology](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-ref.html)
section in the Bazel documentation.
