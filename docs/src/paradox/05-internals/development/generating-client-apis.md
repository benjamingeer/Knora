# Generating Client API Code

The following route returns a Zip file containing generated client API
code for the specified target:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/clientapi/TARGET
```

Currently the only supported `TARGET` is `typescript`. For documentation
on defining client APIs, see
@ref:[Client API Code Generation Framework](../design/client-api/index.md).

To check whether the generated TypeScript code compiles, without actually
integrating it into `knora-api-js-lib`, use:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/clientapi/typescript?mock=true
```

This adds mock TypeScript library dependencies.
