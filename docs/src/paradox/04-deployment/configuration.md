# Configuration

All configuration for Knora is done in `application.conf`. Besides the Knora application
specific configuration, there we can also find configuration for the underlying Akka library.

For optimal performance it is important to tune the configuration to the hardware used, mainly
to the number of CPUs and cores per CPU.

The relevant sections for tuning are:

 - `akka.actor.deployment`
 - `knora-ask-dispatcher`
 - `knora-store-dispatcher`
 - `knora-sipi-dispatcher`
 - `knora-v1-dispatcher`
 - `knora-v2-dispatcher`
 - `knora-admin-dispatcher`
