***************************************
v1.4.0 Release Notes (not released yet)
***************************************

See the `release`_ and closed tickets on the `v1.4.0 milestone`_ on Github.


Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

- Every ontology must now have the property ``knora-base:attachedToProject``, which points to the IRI of the
  project that is responsible for the ontology. This must be added to each project-specific ontology in existing
  repositories. All built-in ontologies have been updated to have this property, and must therefore be reloaded
  into existing repositories.

  The property ``knora-base:projectOntology`` has been removed, and must be removed from project
  definitions in existing repositories.

- Every project now needs to have the property ``knora-base:projectShortcode`` set.



New features:
-------------

- A project-specific ontology can now be deleted via API v2.
- Added OpenAPI / Swagger API documentation route
- The Knora API server now checks the validity of ontologies on startup.
- The property ``knora-base:projectShortcode`` is now a required property (was optional).

Bugfixes:
---------

- API v1 extended search was not properly handling multiple conditions on list values (issue #800)
- Fix image orientation in SALSAH 1 (issue #726)
