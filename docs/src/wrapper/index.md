# Knora Documentation Overview

The Knora Stack consist of the following components:

 - The Frontend:
    - [Salsah1](http://wiki.salsah.org) (old version)
    - [Salsah2](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Salsah/) (new version still in development)
 - The API Server: 
    - [webapi (new documentation style)](/paradox/index.html)
    - [webapi (old documentation style)](/sphinx/index.html)
 - The IIIF Server: [sipi](https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Sipi/documentation/index.html)
 - A triplestore: [Graphdb-Free](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/free/) or [GraphDB-SE](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/standard/)
 
@@@ note

Currently, there are two flavors of documentation for the API Server. The first is Sphinx-based, which is our original
or older style to write documentation, and second the Paradox-Markdown-based newer style. We are currently in a
transitioning phase, where we slowly move chapters from Sphinx to Paradox.
