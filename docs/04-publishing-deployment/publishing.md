# Publishing

Knora is published as a set of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images under the
[DaSCH Basel Dockerhub Organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/daschswiss).

The following Docker images are published:

- Knora-API:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/knora-api
- Jena Fuseki:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/knora-jena-fuseki
- Sipi (includes Knora's Sipi scripts):
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/knora-sipi
- Salsah 1:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/knora-salsah1
- Salsah 2:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/knora-app-web

Knora's Docker images are published automatically through Github CI each time a
pull-request is merged into the `develop` branch.

Each image is tagged with a version number, where the version is derived by
using the result of `git describe`. The describe version is built from the
`last tag + number of commits since tag + short hash`, e.g., `8.0.0-7-ga7827e9`.

The images can be published locally by running:

```bash
$ make docker-build
```

or to Dockerhub:

```bash
$ make docker-publish
```
