# v30 to v31

## Breaking changes

In v31, the previously existing properties `knora-base:isSequenceOf` and `knora-base:hasSequenceBounds` 
have been removed from the ontology. 
They have been replaced by the new, more elaborate `Segment` concept.
More information can be found [here](../02-dsp-ontologies/knora-base.md#segment).

## Migration

If you have used `knora-base:isSequenceOf` and `knora-base:hasSequenceBounds` in your data,
this should be replaced by `knora-base:isAudioSegmentOf` or `knora-base:isVideoSegmentOf` respectively,
and `knora-base:hasSegmentBounds`.

The issue with that is that these properties are only allowed 
on resources of type `knora-base:AudioSegment` and `knora-base:VideoSegment`,
whereas previously `knora-base:isSequenceOf` could be added to any `knora-base:Resource`. 
This means that you will have to change the type of the resources that you have been using
to be of type `knora-base:AudioSegment` or `knora-base:VideoSegment`.
