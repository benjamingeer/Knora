# Overview

Generally, DSP-API is designed to be backward compatible. 
Whenever a new major version of DSP-API is released, 
the existing data is migrated to the new version automatically. 
The public Rest API is also stable and should remain backward compatible.

However, when a feature appears not to be used, 
or if there are urgent technical reasons to change the API,
we may decide to release breaking changes. 
In these instances, we try to provide a migration guide, 
in case some project or application is affected by the change.

If you experience any issues with the migration,
please contact us via the [DaSCH Help Center](https://www.dasch.swiss/help-center).
