# Authentication

## Login and Logout

When a client accesses the **/v1/session?login** route successfully, it
gets back headers requesting that a cookie is created, which will store
the session token. On all subsequent calls to any route, this session
token needs to be sent with each request. Normally, a web browser does
this automatically, i.e. sends the cookie on every request. The session
token is used by the server to retrieve the user profile. If successful,
the user is deemed authenticated.

To **logout** the client can call the same route and provide the logout
parameter **/v1/session?logout**. This will invalidate the session token
and return headers for removing the cookie on the client.

## Submitting Credentials

For **login**, credentials in form of *email* and *password* need to be
sent with the request.

There are two possibilities to do so:

  - in the URL submitting the parameters `email` and `password`
    (e.g.,
    <http://knora-host/v1/resources/resIri?email=userUrlEncodedEmail&password=pw>)
  - in the HTTP authorization header ([HTTP basic
    authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication))
    when doing a HTTP request to the API 
    
When using Python's module `requests`, the credentials (email / password) can simply be 
submitted as a tuple with each request using the param `auth` 
([python requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/authentication/#basic-authentication)).

An alternative way for accessing all routes is to simply supply the
*email* and *password* credentials on each request either as URL
parameters or in the HTTP authorization header.

## Checking Credentials

To check the credentials, there is a special route called
**/v1/authenticate**, which can be used to check if the credentials are
valid.

## Usage Scenarios

1.  Create session by logging-in, send session token on each subsequent
    request, and logout when finished.
2.  Send email/password credentials on every request.
