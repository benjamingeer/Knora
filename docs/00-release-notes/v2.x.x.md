# v2.x.x Release Notes


## v2.0.0

This is the first release with the new version numbering convention. From now on, if any changes
to the existing data is necessary for a release, then this release will have its major number increased.
Please see the [Release Versioning Convention](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora#release-versioning-convention)
description.

### Required changes to existing data:

- a `knora-base:ListNode` must have at least one `rdfs:label`. ([#991](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/990))

### New features:

- add developer-centric docker-compose.yml for starting the Knora / GraphDB / Sipi / Salsah1 ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- configure `webapi` and `salsah1` thorough environment variables ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- update for Java 10 ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- comment out the generation of fat jars from `KnoraBuild.sbt` (for now) ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- update ehcache ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- update sbt to 1.2.1 ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- remove Kamon monitoring (for now) since we don't see anything meaningful there. We probably will have to instrument Knora by hand and then use Kamon for access. ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))
- update Dockerfiles for `webapi` and `salsah1` ([#979](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/979))

- add support for shared ontologies ([#987](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/987))

### Bugfixes:

- trouble with xml-checker and/or consistency-checker during bulk import ([#978](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api/issues/978))
