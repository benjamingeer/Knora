Administration (Users, Projects, Groups)
=========================================

Scope
------

This Section includes management (creation, updating, deletion) of *Users*, *Groups*, and *Projects*.

Implementation
---------------
All administration functions will be implemented as part of the Knora API in the ``webapi`` codebase. There will also be
a separate web-application as part of the ``salsah`` codebase.


Definitions
------------



Overview
---------

During the initial deployment of a Knora server, the main administration user (*root*) is created. This *root* user has
the right to do anything.

Knora’s concept of access control is that an object (a resource or value) can grant permissions to groups of users (but
not to individual users). There are four built-in *smart* groups: *UnknownUser*, *KnownUser*, *ProjectMember*, *Owner*.
A user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying some condition.

**UnknownUser**:
    Any user who has not logged into the Knora API server is automatically assigned to this group.

**KnownUser**:
    Any user who has logged into the Knora API server is automatically assigned to this group.

**ProjectMember**:
    When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if
    she is a member of the project that the object belongs to.

**Owner**:
    When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if he is
    the owner of the object.


Access Controll Matrix
-----------------------
Some changes require administrative permissions. These permissions are given to a user by being a member of a smart
group. As before, a user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying some condition, i.e. having a
special property attached to the user.

**SystemAdmin**:
  This group gives the user all permissions. The ``root`` user is by default member of this group. Membership is
  received by setting the property ``knora-base:hasSystemAdminPermissions`` to ``true`` on a ``knora-base:User``.
  Can be assigned to a user only by the ``root`` user.

**ProjectAdmin**:
  This group gives a single user the administrative permissions for a specific *project*. Membership is received by
  adding the property ``knora-base:isProjectAdmin`` to the user and by pointing it to the project. Can be assigned to
  a user by ``SystemAdmin`` or other ``ProjectAdmin``. Received automatically by creating the project.

**GroupAdmin**:
  This group gives a single user the administrative permissions for a specific *group*. Membership is received by
  setting the property ``knora-base:isGroupAdmin`` to the user and by pointing to the group. Can be assigned to a user
  by ``SystemAdmin`` of other ``GroupAdmin``. Received automatically by creating the group.


The access control matrix defines what operations a *subject* (i.e. User), being a member of a special group
(represented by row headers), is permitted to perform on an *object* (represented by column headers). The different
operation abbreviations used are defined as follows:

*C*:
  *Create* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *create* the object.

*U*:
  *Update* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *update* the object.

*R*:
  *Read* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *read* **all** information about the object.

*D*:
  *Delete* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *delete* the object.

+-------------------+---------+---------+-----------------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

Default Permissions
--------------------

It will be possible to define default permissions for newly created resources / values on the *system*, *project*, and
*user* level. The following properties need to be defined to point to a list of IRI's of instances of
'knora-base:UserGroup': ``knora-base:hasDefaultRestrictedViewPermission``, ``knora-base:hasDefaultViewPermission``,
``knora-base:hasDefaultModifyPermission``, ``knora-base:hasDefaultDeletePermission``. These default permissions can then
be explicitly submitted by the client with each creation request. The user should be presented with a selection of
available default permissions, when creating a resource / value in the client.

The smart groups can be also used as values for the properties. The IRI is constructed by appending the name of the
built-in smart group to ``http://data.knora.org/groups/``, e.g., ``http://data.knora.org/groups/KnownUser``.


Use Cases
----------

UC01: Teaching a Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**:
  I'm teaching a class and I have the names and email addresses of all the students. I want to create a project, divide
  the students into groups (which will only be relevant to this project, e.g. one group for each section of the class),
  and put some students in each group. I don't want people to be able to join the project or the group by themselves.

**Solution**:
  The teacher creates different groups and adds users to those groups. Additionally, the teacher can give TA's
  *GroupAdmin* privileges, and let the TA's add students to the different groups.

UC02: Unibas Librarian
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Description**:
  I'm a Unibas librarian managing several archiving projects. I need to give everyone at the university permission to
  view all these projects. I want to create a group called *UnibasUser* that everyone with a Unibas email address will
  automatically belong to. Most of the resources in those projects can then grant view permission to *UnibasUser*. Or
  perhaps the group will be *SwitchUser*, for anyone at a Swiss university. Or something even broader.

**Solution**:
  These can be solved by creating *Smart Groups*, where the user can define what properties need to be set, so that
  an user is automatically part of this group. This will be implemented at a later time, as it is not trivial and should
  also include all special groups (e.g., KnownUser, ProjectMember, ProjectAdmin, etc.) that are currently hard-coded
  inside the system.

UC03: Crowdsourcing Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**:
  I'm doing a crowdsourcing project, which involves several different groups that work on different tasks. I'm hoping
  for thousands of users, and I'd like anyone to be able to join the project and add themselves to any group they want
  (as long as Knora verifies their email address), without needing approval from me.

**Solution**:
  This can be solved by allowing self-assignment to a group.

UC04: User "left" Knora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**:
  An user who was an active collaborator, decides to "quit", and wants to delete his user.

**Solution**:
  The user's IRI is saved on each value change as part of the versioning mechanism. Exchanging the user's IRI in
  those places would count as 'rewriting history'. So deleting a user will not be possible, instead the user will be
  set as ``not active``.

Webapi Components
------------------

For the management of *users*, *projects*, and *groups*, the Knora API following a resource centric approach, provides
three endpoints corresponding to the three classes of objects that they have an effect on, namely:

* Users Endpoint: ``http://server:port/v1/users`` -> ``knora-base:User``
* Projects Endpoint: ``http://server:port/v1/projects`` -> ``knora-base:knoraProject``
* Groups Endpoint: ``http://server:port/v1/groups`` -> ``knora-base:UserGroup``

All information regarding users, projects and groups is stored in the ``http://www.knora.org/admin`` named graph.
