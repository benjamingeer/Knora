***************************************
v1.3.0 Release Notes (not released yet)
***************************************

See the `release`_ and closed tickets on the `v1.3.0 milestone`_ on Github.


Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------

1. Replace salsah-gui ontology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must replace the ``salsah-gui`` ontology that you have in the triplestore with the one
in ``salsah-gui.ttl``.

New features:
-------------

1. More support for salsah-gui elements and attributes in ontologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Serve the ``salsah-gui`` ontology in API v2 in the default schema.
- Show ``salsah-gui:guiElement`` and ``salsah-gui:guiAttribute`` when serving ontologies in API v2 in the default schema.
- Allow ``salsah-gui:guiElement`` and ``salsah-gui:guiAttribute`` to be included in new property definitions created via API v2.
- Change ``salsah-gui`` so that GraphDB's consistency checker can check the use of ``guiElement`` and ``guiAttribute``.

Bugfixes:
---------

- When API v2 served ``knora-api`` (default schema), ``salsah-gui:guiElement`` and ``salsah-gui:guiAttribute`` were not shown in properties in that ontology.
- The predicate ``salsah-gui:guiOrder`` was not accepted when creating a property via API v2.
