# ADR-0005 Change ResponderManager to a simple case class

Date: 2022-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The `org.knora.webapi.responders.ResponderManager` was implemented as an Akka-Actor.

## Decision

In preparation of the move from `Akka` to `ZIO`, it was decided that the `ResponderManager` is refactored using plain `case` classes.

## Consequences

The actor messages and responses don't change. 
All calls made previously to the `ResponderManager` and the `StorageManager` 
are now changed to the `ApplicationActor` 
which will route the calls to either the `ResponderManager` 
or the `StorageManager`, based on the message type. 
The `ApplicationActor` is the only actor that is allowed to make calls 
to either the `ResponderManager` or the `StorageManager`. 
All requests from routes are now routed to the `ApplicationActor`.
