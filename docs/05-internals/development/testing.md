# Testing

Prerequisite: Before running any tests, a supported triplestore needs to
be started and initialized through a script inside the "scripts" folder.
For example, when using "GraphDB Free", the nedded script is
"graphdb-free-init-knora-test-unit.sh". Please note the occurrence of
"test-unit" in the name of the script.

## How to Write Unit Tests

1)  Inside a test, at the beginning, add the following (change the paths
    to the test data as needed):

```scala
val rdfDataObjects = List (
       RdfDataObject(path = "_test_data/responders.v1.ValuesResponderV1Spec/incunabula-data.ttl", name = "http://www.knora.org/data/incunabula")
)
```
The data will be automatically loaded before any tests are executed. These tests should be stored inside
the `src/test` folder hierarchy.

2)  Call the test from SBT:

```
// when using a GraphDB-SE
sbt:knora> webapi / test

// when using a GraphDB-Free
sbt:knora> webapi / GDBFree / test
```

## How to Write Integration Tests

The only difference between Integration and Unit tests is the location
where they are stored and the way how they are called:

1)  Store tests inside the `src/it` folder hierarchy.
2)  Call the tests from SBT: `sbt:knore> webapi / it:test`

## How to Write Performance / Simulation Tests

1)  Store the performance and simulation tests inside the `src/test` and
    the `src/it` folder hierarchy.
2)  To call them, execute either `webapi / gatling:test` or `webapi / gatling-it:test`
    from inside SBT.

Bellow is an example of an simulation calling the `/admin/users`
endpoint. The simulation ramps up 1000 users over 5 seconds, all
accessing the `/admin/users`
endpoint.

## Custom SBT Test Configurations

For convenience, there are a number of custom test configurations defined inside `WebapiBuild.sbt`. These can be used together with the
built-in test tasks like `test`, `testOnly`, `testQuick`.

For use with GraphDB-SE (using `test/resources/graphdb-se.conf`) running normal tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / test
sbt:knora> webapi / GDBSE / test
sbt:knora> webapi / gdbse:test
```

For use with GraphDB-SE (using `it/resources/graphdb-se.conf`) running integration tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / it:test
sbt:knora> webapi / GDBSEIt / test
sbt:knora> webapi / gdbse-it:test
```

For use with GraphDB-Free (using `test/resources/graphdb-free.conf`) running normal tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / GDBFree / test
sbt:knora> webapi / gdbfree:test
```

For use with GraphDB-Free (using `it/resources/graphdb-free.conf`) running integration tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / GDBFreeIt / test
sbt:knora> webapi / gdbfree-it:test
```

For use with Fuseki (using `test/resources/fuseki.conf`) running normal tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / Fuseki / test
sbt:knora> webapi / fuseki:test
```

For use with Fuseki (using `it/resources/fuseki.conf`) running integration tests:

```
sbt:knora> webapi / FusekiIt / test
sbt:knora> webapi / fuseki-it:test
```
