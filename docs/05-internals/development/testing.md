# Testing

## How to Write Unit Tests

1)  Inside a test, at the beginning, add the following (change the paths
    to the test data as needed):

```scala
val rdfDataObjects = List (
       RdfDataObject(path = "test_data/responders.v1.ValuesResponderV1Spec/incunabula-data.ttl", name = "http://www.knora.org/data/incunabula")
)
```
The data will be automatically loaded before any tests are executed. These tests should be stored inside
the `src/test` folder hierarchy.

2)  Call the test from terminal:

```
$ make test-unit
$ make test-e2e
```

## How to Write Integration Tests

The only difference between Integration and Unit tests is the location
where they are stored and the way how they are called:

1)  Store tests inside the `src/it` folder hierarchy.
2)  Call the tests from the terminal: `make test-it`
