# Updating Repositories

## Requirements

- When a new version of Knora requires an existing repository to be updated,
  do this automatically when Knora starts, if possible.
  
- Make the update process as fast as possible, with some indication of progress
  as it runs.

## Design

As explained in
[Knora Ontology Versions](../../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.md#knora-ontology-versions),
the `knora-base` ontology contains a version string to ensure compatibility
between a repository and a given version of Knora. The same version string
is therefore hard-coded in the Knora source code, in the string constant
`org.knora.webapi.KnoraBaseVersion`. For new pull requests, the format of this string
is `knora-base vN`, where `N` is an integer that is incremented for
each version.

During Knora's startup process, `ApplicationActor` sends an `UpdateRepositoryRequest`
message to the `StoreManager`, which forwards it to `TriplestoreManager`, which delegates
it to `org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.RepositoryUpdater`.

`RepositoryUpdater` does the following procedure:

1. Check the `knora-base` version string in the repository.

2. Consult `org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.RepositoryUpdatePlan` to see which
   transformations are needed.

3. Download the entire repository from the triplestore into a TriG file.

4. Read the TriG file into an RDF4J `Model`.

5. Update the `Model` by running the necessary transformations, and replacing the
   built-in Knora ontologies with the current ones.

6. Save the `Model` to a new TriG file.

7. Empty the repository in the triplestore.

8. Upload the transformed repository file to the triplestore.

To update the `Model`, `RepositoryUpdater` runs a sequence of upgrade plugins, each of which
is a class in `org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.plugins` and is registered
in `RepositoryUpdatePlan`.

## Design Rationale

We tried and rejected several other designs:

- Running SPARQL updates in the triplestore: too slow, and no way to report
  progress during the update.
  
- Downloading the repository and transforming it in Python using
  [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): too slow.
  
- Downloading the repository and transforming it in C++ using
  [Redland](http://librdf.org): also too slow.

The Scala implementation is the fastest by far.

The whole repository is uploaded in a single transaction, rather than uploading one named
graph at a time, because GraphDB's consistency checker can enforce dependencies between
named graphs.

## Adding an Upgrade Plugin

Each time a pull request introduces changes that are not compatible
with existing data, the following must happen:

- The `knora-base` version number must be incremented in `knora-base.ttl` and
  in the string constant `org.knora.webapi.KnoraBaseVersion`.
  
- A plugin must be added in the package `org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.plugins`,
  and registered in `RepositoryUpdatePlan`, to transform
  existing repositories so that they are compatible with the code changes
  introduced in the pull request.

The order of version numbers must correspond to the order in which the pull requests
are merged.

An upgrade plugin is a Scala class that extends `UpgradePlugin`. The name of the plugin
class should refer to the pull request that made the transformation necessary,
using the format `UpgradePluginPRNNNN`, where `NNNN` is the number of the pull request.

A plugin's `transform` method takes an RDF4J `Model` (a mutable object representing
the repository) and modifies it as needed. For details on how to do this, see
[The RDF Model API](https://rdf4j.eclipse.org/documentation/programming/model/)
in the RDF4J documentation.

Before transforming the data, a plugin can check whether a required manual transformation
has been carried out. If the requirement is not met, the plugin can throw
`InconsistentTriplestoreDataException` to abort the upgrade process.

The plugin must then be appended to the sequence `pluginsForVersions` in
`RepositoryUpdatePlan`.

## Testing Update Plugins

Each plugin should have a unit test that extends `UpgradePluginSpec`. A typical
test loads a TriG file containing test data into a `Model`, runs the plugin,
makes an RDF4J `SailRepository` containing the transformed `Model`, and uses
SPARQL to check the result.
