# Lists Endpoint
## To use some of the routes in this endpoint the [feature toggle](../feature-toggles.md), `new-list-admin-routes:1` must
 be activated.

## Endpoint Overview

**List Item Operations:**

- `POST: /admin/lists` : create new list item (root or child node). To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.

- `GET: /admin/lists[?projectIri=<projectIri>]` : return all lists optionally filtered by project

- `GET: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>` : if given a root node IRI, return complete list with all children. 
Otherwise, if given a child node IRI, it returns node completely with its immediate children. 
To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.

- `GET: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>/info` : return information (without children) of the node whose IRI is given 
(root or child). To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.

- `PUT: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>` : update information of the node (root or child).
- `PUT: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>/name` : update the name of the node (root or child).
- `PUT: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels` : update labels of the node (root or child).
- `PUT: /admin/lists/<listItemIri>/comments` : update comments of the node (root or child).

### Create new item (entire list or a node)
To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.
  - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
  - POST: `/admin/lists`
  - BODY:
  
#### Create an entirely new list
The IRI of the project must be given in the body of the request to which the list 
is supposed to be attached. 
Further basic information about the list such as its `labels` and `comments` must also be provided. 
Optionally, the request body can contain a `name` for the list which must be unique in the project.

```json
    {
        "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
        "labels": [{ "value": "Neue Liste", "language": "de"}],
        "comments": []
    } 
```

Additionally, each list can have an optional custom IRI (of [Knora IRI](../api-v2/knora-iris.md#iris-for-data) form) specified by the `id` in the request body as below:

```json
  {
    "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
    "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
    "name": "a new list",
    "labels": [{ "value": "Neue Liste mit IRI", "language": "de"}],
    "comments": []
  }
```

The response will contain the basic information of the list, `listinfo` and an empty list of its children, as below:

```json
{
    "list": {
        "children": [],
        "listinfo": {
            "comments": [],
            "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
            "isRootNode": true,
            "labels": [
                {
                    "value": "Neue Liste mit IRI",
                    "language": "de"
                }
            ],
            "name": "a new list",
            "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Create a new child node
The IRI of its parent node must be given in the request body by `parentNodeIri`. 
Furthermore, the request body should also contain the project IRI of the list and basic information of the node as below:
  
```json
     {   
         "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
         "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
         "name": "a child",
         "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
         "comments": []
    }
```

Additionally, each child node can have an optional custom IRI (of [Knora IRI](../api-v2/knora-iris.md#iris-for-data) form) specified by the `id` in the request body as below:

```json
{    "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
     "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
     "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
     "name": "a child",
     "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
     "comments": []
}
```

The response will contain the basic information of the node, `nodeinfo`, as below:

```json
{
    "nodeinfo": {
        "comments": [],
        "hasRootNode": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
        "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
        "labels": [
            {
                "value": "New List Node",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "name": "a new child",
        "position": 1
    }
}
```

### Update basic information (entire list or a node)
The basic information of a list or a node such as its labels, comments, name, or all of them can be updated. The parameters that 
must be updated together with the new value must be given in the JSON body of the request together with the IRI of the 
list item (root or child node) and the IRI of the project it belongs to. 

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update list information
 - Response:
     - If the IRI of the list (i.e. root node) is given, return basic information of the list, `listinfo` without children.
    - If the IRI of a child node is given, return basic information of the node, `nodeinfo`, without its children.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>`
 - BODY:
 
```json
   {
       "listIri": "listIri",
       "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
       "name": "a new name",
       "labels": [{ "value": "Neue geönderte Liste", "language": "de"}, { "value": "Changed list", "language": "en"}],
       "comments": [{ "value": "Neuer Kommentar", "language": "de"}, { "value": "New comment", "language": "en"}]
   }
```
If only name of the list must be updated, it can be given as below in the body of the request:

```json
   {
       "listIri": "listIri",
       "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
       "name": "another name"
  }
```

Alternatively, basic information `name`, `labels`, or `comments` or a list or a child node can be updated individually 
as explained below.

### Update list or node's name

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update name of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/name`
 - BODY:
 The new name of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "name": "a new name"
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Update list or node's labels

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update labels of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels`
 - BODY:
 The new set of labels of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "labels": [{"language": "se", "value": "nya märkningen"}]
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Update list or node's comments

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update comments of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels`
 - BODY:
 The new set of comments of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "comments": [{"language": "se", "value": "nya kommentarer"}]
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Delete a list or a node
An entire list or a single node of it can be completely deleted, if not in use. Before deleting an entire list 
(i.e. root node), the data and ontologies are checked for any usage of the list or its children. If not in use, the list 
and all its children are deleted.

Similarily, before deleting a single node of a list, it is verified that the node itself and none of its children are used.
If not in use, the node and all its children are deleted. Once a node is deleted, its parent node is updated by shifting the 
remaining child nodes with respect to the position of the deleted node. 

- Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
- Response:
    - If the IRI of the list (i.e. root node) is given, the `iri` of the deleted list with a flag `deleted: true` is returned.
    - If the IRI of a child node is given, the updated parent node is returned.

- Delete `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>`
