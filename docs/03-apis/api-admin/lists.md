list and the IRI of the project it belongs to. 

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update list information
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listIri>`
 - BODY:
 
```json
 {   "listIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
      "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
      "name": "new name for the list",
      "labels": [{ "value": "a new label for the list", "language": "en"}],
      "comments": [{ "value": "a new comment for the list", "language": "en"}]
  }
```

The response will contain the basic information of the list, `listinfo`, without its children, as below:
```json
{
    "listinfo": {
        "comments": [
            {
                "value": "a new comment for the list",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
        "isRootNode": true,
        "labels": [
            {
                "value": "a new label for the list",

        ],
        "name": "new name for the list",
        "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001"
    }
}
```
If only name of the list must be updated, it can be given as below in the body of the request:

```json
   {
       "listIri": "listIri",
       "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
       "name": "another name"

```

Alternatively, basic information `name`, `labels`, or `comments` of the root node (i.e. list) can be updated individually 
as explained below.

### Update list or node's name

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update name of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.

 - BODY:
 The new name of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "name": "a new name"
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Update list or node's labels

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update labels of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels`
 - BODY:
 The new set of labels of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "labels": [{"language": "se", "value": "nya märkningen"}]
}
```

 - Return node information, `nodeinfo`, (without children).
 - GET: `/admin/lists/nodes/<nodeIri>`


### Create new child node

  - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
  - Appends a new child node under the supplied nodeIri. If the supplied nodeIri
    is the listIri, then a new child node is appended to the top level. Children
    are currently only appended.
  - POST: `/admin/lists/<parentNodeIri>`
  - BODY:
  
```json
     {   
         "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",

         "name": "a child",
         "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
         "comments": []
    }
```

Additionally, each child node can have an optional custom IRI (of [Knora IRI](../api-v2/knora-iris.md#iris-for-data) form) specified by the `id` in the request body as below:

```json
{    "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
     "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
     "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
     "name": "a child",
     "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
     "comments": []
}
```

The response will contain the basic information of the node, `nodeinfo`, as below:
```json

                "value": "New List Node",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "name": "a new child",
        "position": 1
    }
}
```

### Update node's information
The basic information of a node such as its labels, comments, name, or all of them can be updated. The parameters that 
must be updated together with the new value must be given in the JSON body of the request together with the IRI of the 
node and the IRI of the project it belongs to. 

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update node information
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<nodeIri>`
 - BODY:
 
```json
  {   "listIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
       "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
       "name": "new node name",
       "labels": [{ "value": "new node label", "language": "en"}],
       "comments": [{ "value": "new node comment", "language": "en"}]
   }
```

The response will contain the basic information of the node as `nodeInfo` without its children, as below:

```json
{
    "nodeinfo": {
        "comments": [
            {
                "value": "new node comment",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "hasRootNode": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
        "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
        "labels": [
            {
                "value": "new node label",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "name": "new node name",
        "position": 0
    }
}
```

If only name of the node must be updated, it can be given as below in the body of the request:

```json
   {
      "listIri": "nodeIri",
      "projectIri": "projectIri",
      "name": "another name"
  }
```

Alternatively, basic information of the child node can be updated individually as explained above (See 
[update node name](#update-list-or-nodes-name), [update node labels](#update-list-or-nodes-labels), and 
[update node comments](#update-list-or-nodes-comments)).

### Delete a list or a node
An entire list or a single node of it can be completely deleted, if not in use. Before deleting an entire list 
(i.e. root node), the data and ontologies are checked for any usage of the list or its children. If not in use, the list 
and all its children are deleted.

Similarily, before deleting a single node of a list, it is verified that the node itself and none of its children are used.
If not in use, the node and all its children are deleted. Once a node is deleted, its parent node is updated by shifting the 
remaining child nodes with respect to the position of the deleted node. 

- Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
- Response:
    - If the IRI of the list (i.e. root node) is given, the `iri` of the deleted list with a flag `deleted: true` is returned.
    - If the IRI of a child node is given, the updated parent node is returned.

- Delete `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>`
